        <p>The UK’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic last March compares poorly with that of other countries. Not everything went wrong: researchers and doctors at UCL and Oxford University rushed into research for treatments and to develop a vaccine; the Government developed a furlough scheme in support for businesses and extended (even if many say they weren’t brave enough) the reach of Universal Credit. On the other hand, it’s hard to ignore a massive list of errors that could have been avoided. The delays in introducing a lockdown in March 2020, the premature lifting of the lockdown last summer, the inconsistencies in school policies, the neglect of social care, the lack of capacity in community testing and contact tracing, the lack of financial support for people asked to self-isolate, are all things that impacted deeply the awful death rate the UK scored during the pandemic. But it doesn’t end here, with the poor choices of a government unwilling to learn from its mistakes and reluctant to draw on the expertise and intelligence of the devolved administrations, regional, and local government leaders. With the passing of the months, a darker pattern of behaviour has been emerging and is now all over the news, with even the BBC talking about “cronyism”: it appears that the UK government began awarding PPE contracts under an emergency procedure in which deals were handed directly to companies without competition. Thousands of contracts - including orders for gowns, gloves and face masks - have been awarded to private companies by the government since then and billions of pounds of public money has been spent. The government has been accused of favouring firms with political connections to the Conservative Party with a "high-priority lane" and of total lack of transparency in the process.
