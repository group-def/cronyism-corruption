Hi, and thanks for helping us with this!

We are working on a project on all the decisions taken by the UK government in dealing with the COVID-19 
pandemic since March 2020. The main part of it is a game which we have developed in two distinct formats which 
we would like your opinion on! We will ask you to test both formats (it will take ~10 minutes) and to give us 
your feedback on a Google form (~5 minutes). Whilst this is ultimately to decide which question format we will use, 
any feedback on the general quality will be appreciated, e.g. if certain questions or answer cards don't make sense, 
as this is still an early draft so any feedback would be extremely useful. The ultimate goal of our quiz is to engage 
people in debates around the government's handling of the pandemic, so if you have any comments on how we could 
better achieve this, please let us know. Thanks in advance!

In order to take the quiz, simply go into the 'Quiz' folder and open the 'Quiz A.html' - then, afterwards, the 'Quiz B.html' - 
files in your browser, and (if everything is working as it should) that should open the quiz! To answer the 
questions, click the small round button next to each possible answer, then once you wish to submit that answer, 
click the 'Final Answer?' button and an answer card - stating whether you were right or wrong and offering some 
context to the question and answer - will appear. After reading the answer card popup, simply click the 
'Next Question' button to progress, following the same pattern for each question. Once you reach the final question 
the 'Submit Answers' button will appear, but be sure to answer the question first using the 'Final Answer?' button again! 
Finally, after reading the final answer card, press the 'Submit Answers' button to see your overall performance.

The game consists of 6 questions with multiple answers; after every question you will see a card explaining 
why your answer was right or wrong, and the context behind each question.
We will ask you to play it twice, as we have drafted the questions in two very different formats:
TYPE A asks the player to imagine themselves as a member of the UK government, providing a range of scenarios 
which you must respond to in what they believe to be the 'right' way;
TYPE B is a more straight-forward quiz where you will be asked a range of questions concerning various aspects 
of the government's response to the pandemic, to which you must select the correct answer.

Can you help us figure out which format works best?
Thanks a lot for your help!
