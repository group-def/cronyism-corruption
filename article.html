          <h5>While the majority of the UK spent 2020 stuck inside to help stop the spread of Covid-19, the Conservative government have overseen scandal after scandal. From losing the results for over 15,000 Covid tests, to misspending public funds in questionable deals carried out over private messaging apps; 2020 has been a year characterised by cronyism and corruption.</h5>

        <p>As former PM David Cameron has been thrust into the spotlight for his role in lobbying the government on behalf of the failed finance firm, Greensill, issues surrounding lobbying, conflicts of interests, and cronyism have been brought to the forefront of the media’s attention. Despite this, the Greensill scandal is hardly an isolated incident, and for many, it did not come as a surprise following the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic; a year characterised by cronyism, corruption, and misspent public funds.

In the government’s own words, all public procurement must be based on encouraging ‘free and open competition’ in order to achieve ‘value for money’. Yet despite this, the vast majority of contracts were allocated through closed channels - including private WhatsApp conversations between businessmen and politicians - with pest control and jewellery companies being handed high-value contracts for supplying personal protective equipment despite having no experience.

With over £24billion worth of contracts - almost three times the cost of hosting the Olympics in 2012 - given out by February 2021 since the start of the pandemic it is crucial that there is transparency surrounding the ways public funds are allocated.
