      <div class='content'>
        <p>Despite the government spending a whopping £12 billion on its contact tracing system, dubbed Test and Trace, the system was plagued by issues and the app was never released to the public. A large factor contributing to this staggering cost was the government's use of private consultants, of which there were thousands, many of whom were being paid upwards of £1,000 per day - all the while nurses and other key workers were neglected.</p>

          <h1>Contract conundrums</h1>

    </div>
    <div class='regular-wrapper-big'>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Following an investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO), the government has been criticised for its overreliance on emergency procurement regulations to buy goods and services in response to the pandemic. According to their report, around £18 billion worth of contracts were handed out through these emergency procedures, which allow contracts to be allocated directly to companies without any competition. The NAO also found that there was a lack of transparency surrounding the government's procurement tactics, with many contracts being posted late, and a lack of explanation behind key decisions and how conflicts of interest have been managed.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Of the data we analysed - which featured contracts posted on the two largest procurement sites in the UK: Tenders Electronic Daily, and Contracts Finder - only 2 out of the top 300 highest value contracts were allocated through open procedure, with only 7% of all contracts going through open tender.</p>

          <h3>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public procurement is one of the areas of government that's 'most vulnerable to corruption' and can lead to misspending of public funds or higher costs for lower quality goods and services. But if you don't believe them, here are some examples.</h3>

        <p>The government is facing legal action after awarding £250 million worth of PPE contracts to a US jewellery company, Saiger, which had no experience supplying protective equipment and had never previously been awarded a public contract. This contract was allocated without any advertisement or competitive tender process, and resulted in the government overpaying for the gowns at almost twice their value.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>The Department of Health and Social Care awarded the logistics company, Uniserve, a 12 month contract worth almost £500 million to provide freight services for the supply of PPE and medical equipment. However, the company soon began buying and selling PPE for the government, despite having no experience, leading to the government overpaying for protective equipment.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>According to reports from Labour and the Guardian, many local companies across the UK offered their help in supplying PPE but were ignored by the Government, which lead to the opportunity to secure vital PPE at the start of the pandemic being missed.</p>

          <h3>The NAO also identified a 'high-priority channel', where firms with political connections were given preference over other companies. Companies in this lane were reportedly ten times more likely to receive a contract than those in regular channels, which ultimately led to more misspent public funds.</h3>

        <p>Randox - a healthcare firm with close links to the Conservative Party - was awarded a contract worth £133 million for the supply of test kits, without a call for competition. However the kits had to be recalled after being found to be substandard and potentially contaminated.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Serco also managed to secure a £108 million contract that was not put to open tender: their shares immediately soared and the contract was later extended, worth up to £410 million. Later, emails between Serco's directors and members of the Government were leaked, in which they discussed the potential privatisation of the NHS.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Of the data we analysed, 3 of the top 10 highest value contracts were given to companies which have links to the Conservative Party, these were: Randox, who employ Tory MP Owen Paterson as a consultant; Medacs Healthcare, who have links to Tory donor, Lord Ashcroft; and Circle Healthcare, which has donated £1.4 million to the Tory party and has been allowed to run key NHS services. All three of these firms were identified as having credit scores below 40 - a sign that they are experiencing financial difficulties and caution should be taken.</p>

      <div class='content'>
        <p>In February 2021 it was reported that a former neighbour of Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, contacted the minister over Whatsapp to secure a deal worth over £30 million to supply the government with vials for Covid-19 tests despite having no experience in producing medical supplies.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Similarly, Sir James Dyson of Dyson Ltd lobbied the Prime Minister via Whatsapp to ensure his employees would not be hit by any additional taxes with the PM personally assuring Dyson that he would ‘fix’ the issue. Former prime minister, David Cameron, also used Whatsapp to lobby Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, on behalf of finance firm, Greensill Capital, with the hopes of receiving government-backed loans.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class='content'>
        <p>Concerns have been raised about the use of private messaging apps, like Whatsapp, by government officials due to the ability to permanently delete messages, which ministers could use to avoid accountability. The private nature of these dealings also raises issues around access to these channels, which often puts less-connected firms at a disadvantage while privileging companies with links to politicians.</p>

          <p>In January, the government replaced its food voucher scheme with a new initiative aimed at supplying food parcels to families with children eligible for free school meals. The parcels supposedly contained a week's worth of food for a child, but in reality the parcels were severely lacking in nutritional value.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class='content'>
          <p> The government paid £208 million to a private firm, Chartwells, to run the scheme, with close to five million boxes distributed in England. The government has not revealed the cost of each box but, based on the cost of the scheme and the number of boxes delivered, the New Statesman estimates that each box and its underwhelming contents cost the taxpayer over £44.</p>
