          <h5>While the majority of the UK spent 2020 stuck inside to help stop the spread of Covid-19, the Conservative government have overseen scandal after scandal. From losing the results for over 15,000 Covid tests, to misspending public funds in questionable deals carried out over Whatsapp; 2020 has been a year characterised by cronyism and corruption. Let's take a look at some of the year's defining moments...</h5>

        <p>As former PM David Cameron has been thrust into the spotlight for his role in lobbying the government on behalf of the failed finance firm, Greensill, issues surrounding lobbying, conflicts of interests, and cronyism have been brought to the forefront of the media’s attention. Despite this, the Greensill scandal is hardly an isolated incident, and for many, it did not come as a surprise following the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic; a year characterised by cronyism, corruption, and misspent public funds.

In the government’s own words, all public procurement must be based on encouraging ‘free and open competition’ in order to achieve ‘value for money’. Yet despite this, the vast majority of contracts were allocated through closed channels - including private WhatsApp conversations between businessmen and politicians - with pest control and jewellery companies being handed high-value contracts for supplying personal protective equipment despite having no experience.

With over £24billion worth of contracts - almost three times the cost of hosting the Olympics in 2012 - given out by February 2021 since the start of the pandemic it is crucial that there is transparency surrounding the ways public funds are allocated.

        <p>Despite the government spending a whopping £12 billion on its contact tracing system, dubbed Test and Trace, the system was plagued by issues with the app never being released to the public. A large factor contributing to this staggering cost was the government's use of private consultants, of which there were thousands, who were each being paid upwards of £1,000 per day - all the while nurses and other key workers were neglected.</p>

        <p>Following an investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO), the government has been criticised for its overreliance on emergency procurement regulations to buy goods and services in response to the pandemic. According to their report, around £18 billion worth of contracts were handed out through these emergency procedures without going through competitive processes they would normally be obligated to. At the same time, the NAO found that there was a lack of transparency surrounding the government's procurement tactics, with many contracts being posted late, as well as a lack of explanation behind key decisions and how conflicts of interest have been managed.</p>

          <h3>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public procurement is one of the areas of government that's 'most vulnerable to corruption' and can lead to the misspending of public funds or higher expenses and lower quality of goods and services. But if you don't believe them, here's some examples...</h3>
